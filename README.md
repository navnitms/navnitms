# Hello, fellow developers! 👋

I'm Navnit M S, a passionate hobbyist developer who thrives on solving complex problems through code. My journey in software development is driven by curiosity and the continuous pursuit of elegant solutions.

## 💡 What I Do

Hey there! I love building cool stuff that runs behind the scenes - you know, those backend systems that make everything tick! I'm particularly fond of creating command-line tools that make developers' lives easier. Here's what gets me excited:

- Building distributed systems that actually work (and scale!)
- Making things run fast (because who likes waiting?)
- Writing clean code that won't make future-me facepalm
- Keeping the bad guys out with solid security practices

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### ✉️ [ZEPTOMAIL-SDK-GO](https://github.com/navnitms/zeptomail-sdk-go)

## 🌱 Currently Geeking Out On

These days, I'm diving deep into some really cool stuff:
- Network programming (because who doesn't love packets? 📦)
- Cybersecurity (trying to think like a hacker, but for good! 🛡️)
- Making systems talk to each other without chaos 🔄
- Finding out why things are slow and making them zippy! ⚡

## 🌟 Open Source
